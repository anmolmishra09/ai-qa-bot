   # 📝 Development Log

A detailed record of my journey building this AI Q&A Bot.

---

## Day 1: Setup & Planning (1 hour)

### 9:00 AM - Project Kickoff
**Goal**: Understand requirements and plan approach

**Actions**:
- Read assignment carefully
- Chose Project #1 (AI Q&A Bot) because it teaches API integration
- Researched OpenAI vs Hugging Face APIs
- Decision: Start with OpenAI (better documentation for beginners)

**Resources Used**:
- OpenAI documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs
- YouTube: "Python OpenAI API tutorial"

### 10:00 AM - Python Environment Setup
**Goal**: Get Python installed and working

**Attempt 1**: Installing Python
```bash
python --version
# Error: command not found
```
❌ **Failed** - Python not installed

**Attempt 2**: Downloaded Python 3.11
- Went to python.org/downloads
- Downloaded installer
- ⚠️ **Mistake**: Forgot to check "Add to PATH"
- Had to reinstall

**Attempt 3**: Reinstalled with PATH option
```bash
python --version
# Output: Python 3.11.4
```
✅ **Success!**

**Time spent**: 30 minutes (including reinstall)

### 10:30 AM - Git & GitHub Setup
**Goal**: Create repository

**Steps**:
1. Created GitHub account (already had one)
2. Created new repo: `ai-qa-bot`
3. Initialized with README
4. Cloned locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ai-qa-bot.git
```

✅ **Success** - Repository ready

## Day 1: Development (2 hours)

### 11:00 AM - API Key Setup
**Goal**: Get OpenAI API access

**Actions**:
1. Signed up for OpenAI account
2. Went to API keys section
3. Created new API key
4. ⚠️ **Important**: Copied key immediately (can't view again!)

**Initial Mistake**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS!
api_key = "sk-abc123..."  # Hardcoded in code
```

**Research**: Googled "how to secure API keys python"

**Found**: Environment variables and `.env` files

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

**Time spent**: 20 minutes

### 11:20 AM - First Code Attempt
**Goal**: Make first API call

**Attempt 1**: Basic script
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "my-key"
response = openai.Completion.create(...)
```

❌ **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'`

**Research**: Needed to install package

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install openai
```

**Attempt 2**: Ran script again
❌ **Error**: `AttributeError: module 'openai' has no attribute 'Completion'`

**Research**: Checked OpenAI docs - API updated!

**Discovery**: New syntax uses `client.chat.completions.create()`

**Attempt 3**: Updated to new API format
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

✅ **Success!** - Got first response from API

**Time spent**: 40 minutes (lots of trial and error)

### 12:00 PM - Building CLI Version
**Goal**: Create interactive command-line interface

**Features Added**:
- Welcome message
- Input loop
- Quit command
- Error handling

**Challenge**: How to maintain conversation context?

**Research**: Read OpenAI chat docs

**Solution**: Store messages in array and send with each request

```python
conversation_history = []
conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": question})
# Send entire history with each API call
```

**Testing**:
```
You: What is Python?
AI: Python is a programming language...

You: Tell me more about it
AI: [Correctly refers to Python from previous context]
```

✅ **Success!** - Context working

**Time spent**: 45 minutes

### 12:45 PM - Polish & Error Handling
**Goal**: Make it robust

**Issues Found During Testing**:

1. **Empty input crashes program**
   - Added: `if not user_input: continue`

2. **No indication of loading**
   - Added: Print statements with emojis

3. **Confusing error messages**
   - Improved: Friendly error descriptions

**Time spent**: 15 minutes

## Day 2: Stretch Goal - Streamlit UI (1.5 hours)

### 9:00 AM - Learning Streamlit
**Goal**: Understand Streamlit basics

**Actions**:
- Watched: "Streamlit in 10 minutes" YouTube tutorial
- Read: Streamlit docs on session state
- Installed: `pip install streamlit`

**Key Learnings**:
- Streamlit reruns entire script on each interaction
- Use `st.session_state` for persistent data
- Super easy to create UI compared to Flask!

**Time spent**: 30 minutes

### 9:30 AM - Building Web Interface
**Goal**: Create Streamlit app

**Attempt 1**: Basic app
```python
import streamlit as st
st.title("AI Bot")
user_input = st.text_input("Question")
```

✅ Works but no conversation history

**Attempt 2**: Added session state
```python
if 'messages' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []
```

❌ **Issue**: Messages displaying weird

**Research**: Looked at Streamlit chat examples

**Solution**: Use `st.chat_message()` and `st.chat_input()`

**Attempt 3**: Proper chat interface
```python
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])
```

✅ **Success!** - Beautiful chat interface

**Time spent**: 45 minutes

### 10:15 AM - Final Polish
**Goal**: Make it look professional

**Added**:
- Custom page config with icon
- Sidebar with info
- Clear conversation button
- Message counter
- Loading spinner
- Footer

**Final Test**: Ran through multiple scenarios
- ✅ Basic questions work
- ✅ Follow-up questions maintain context
- ✅ Clear button resets properly
- ✅ Error handling works

**Time spent**: 15 minutes

**Sections Written**:
- Features list
- Installation guide
- Usage instructions
- Project structure
- Challenges faced
- Future improvements

**Approach**: Wrote as if teaching someone else

**Time spent**: 30 minutes

### 11:30 AM - Creating DEVELOPMENT_LOG
**Goal**: Document my journey

**Why**: Show learning process and problem-solving

**Content**:
- Every attempt (successful and failed)
- Time spent on each part
- Resources used
- Mistakes made

**Time spent**: 30 minutes

## Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Starting simple**: Got basic version working first
2. **Googling errors**: Found solutions quickly
3. **Testing frequently**: Caught bugs early
4. **Reading docs**: Official documentation is gold
5. **Documenting as I go**: Easier than trying to remember later

### What I'd Do Differently 🔄
1. **Read API docs first**: Would've saved 30 minutes
2. **Virtual environment**: Should've created from start
3. **Git commits**: Should've committed more frequently
4. **Planning**: Sketching UI before coding would help

### Skills Learned 📚

## Mistakes Made & Lessons Learned

### Mistake 1: Hardcoded API Key
**What I did**: Put API key directly in code
**Why it's bad**: Security risk if pushed to GitHub
**Lesson**: Always use environment variables

### Mistake 2: Not Using Virtual Environment
**What I did**: Installed packages globally
**Why it's bad**: Can cause version conflicts
**Lesson**: Always create venv for projects

### Mistake 3: Not Committing Often
**What I did**: Made many changes before first commit
**Why it's bad**: Couldn't track progress or revert
**Lesson**: Commit after each working feature

### Mistake 4: Skipping Error Handling Initially
**What I did**: Assumed everything would work
**Why it's bad**: App crashed on edge cases
**Lesson**: Add error handling from the start

## Future Me Notes 📌

If I were to continue this project:

1. **Add tests**: Learn pytest and add unit tests
2. **Database**: Store conversations in SQLite
3. **Deploy**: Try deploying on Streamlit Cloud
4. **Authentication**: Add user login
5. **Cost tracking**: Monitor API usage
6. **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse
7. **Caching**: Cache common responses

## Final Thoughts 💭

This project taught me that:
- **Building > Reading**: Hands-on learning is most effective
- **Errors are teachers**: Each bug taught me something
- **Documentation matters**: Future me appreciates present me's notes
- **Start small**: MVP first, polish later
- **Google is OK**: Everyone does it!

**Would I do it again?** Absolutely! Maybe I'll try the Text Summarizer next.

**Advice for others**: Just start! Don't wait to feel "ready". You learn by doing.
